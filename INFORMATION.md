## 💡 Project Selection Thought Process

When selecting the project, I focused on three main criteria:

- ✅ Fast development timeline
- ✅ Minimal technology stack
- ✅ Low complexity

#### ⚡ Fast Development Timeline

My top priority was to choose a project I could complete quickly. After considering several ideas, I realized this one only required basic CRUD operations for the MVP, with no need for complex packages or third-party integrations.

#### 🧰 Minimal Technology Stack

I wanted to minimize the technologies involved. This project allowed me to skip a backend setup and use **Zustand** for global state management. Zustand stored all data locally, simulating backend behavior efficiently.

#### 🧠 Low Complexity

Alternative project ideas, like an Event Discovery Platform or a Garage Storage Marketplace, introduced added complexity such as geolocation, maps, or complex user interactions. I chose this project for its simplicity and clear scope.
